However , fully encompassed organs only account for 50 % ± 19 % of k factor and 46 % ± 24 % of q factor . Dose received by partially encompassed organs is also substantial . To estimate effective dose and risk index from DLP , it is necessary to use conversion coefficients specific to the anatomical region examined .

Meiosis takes place during gametogenesis ( process of gamete production ) giving rise to haploid cells . • Somatic cells contain homologous pairs of chromosomes , whereas gametes contain only unpaired chromosomes . • Somatic cells form internal and external structures of the body , whereas gametes do not . • Somatic cells are found almost everywhere in the body , whereas gametes are restricted to certain parts . Unlike the somatic cells , gametes are haploid cells , which carry unpaired chromosomes . A gamete of a particular multicellular organism always carries only half the number of chromosomes carried by a somatic cell of that particular organism . • Somatic cells contain homologous pairs of chromosomes , whereas gametes contain only unpaired chromosomes . • Somatic cells form internal and external structures of the body , whereas gametes do not . • Somatic cells are found almost everywhere in the body , whereas gametes are restricted to certain parts . In humans , n = 23 . Gametes contain half the chromosomes contained in normal diploid cells of the body , which are also known as somatic cells . Haploid gametes are produced during meiosis , which is a type of cell division that reduces the number of chromosomes in a parent diploid cell by half . The term haploid can also refer to the number of chromosomes in egg or sperm cells , which are also called gametes . In humans , gametes are haploid cells that contain 23 chromosomes , each of which a one of a chromosome pair that exists in diplod cells . In animals , somatic cells are produced by mitosis and ________ are produced by meiosis . After telophase I of meiosis , the chromosomal makeup of each daughter cell is .

Gametes are an organism ' s reproductive cells . They are also referred to as sex cells . Female gametes are called ova or egg cells , and male gametes are called sperm . Gametes are haploid cells , and each cell carries only one copy of each chromosome . These reproductive cells are produced through a type of cell division called meiosi Gametes ( sperm and ova ) are haploid cells . The haploid gametes produced by most organisms combine to form a zygote with n pairs of chromosomes , i.e . 2 n chromosomes in total . The chromosomes in each pair , one of which comes from the sperm and one from the egg , are said to be homologous . Cells and organisms with pairs of homologous chromosomes are called diploid . For example , most animals are diploid and produce haploid gametes . During meiosis , sex cell precursors have their number of chromosomes halved by randomly choosing one member of each pair of chromosomes , resulting in	in animals somatic cells are produced by and gametic cells are produced by
